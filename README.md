Project Title
Lab 5 - Data Analysis with Pandas & Matplotlib

Short Description
This project explores data analysis using Python. It uses pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and seaborn libraries to analyze a dataset (Salaries.csv). The notebook performs data exploration, visualization, and basic statistical analysis.

Getting Started

Running the Tests
Breakdown of Tests
The notebook contains various data analysis steps, such as:
Displaying the first 20 rows of the dataset (df.head(20)).
Counting unique values in key columns like salary and discipline.
Checking data types and structures using df.info().
Visualizing data distributions using matplotlib and seaborn.
